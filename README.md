## Certain Gains in Understanding of Prospect Theory: Exploring the Robustness of Framing Effects and the Impact of Cognitive Ability


According to prospect theory, people making decisions under uncertainty are risk-averse when thinking about what they can gain but risk-seeking when thinking about what they can
lose. Important supportive evidence comes from studies involving the Asian Disease problem. This paper explores whether those results are artifacts of suboptimal question wording and a
reliance on college student samples, and whether intelligence moderates the effect. The expected asymmetry appeared in a representative national probability sample of American adults and in heterogeneous non-probability samples of adult volunteers across a variety of alternative question wordings, attesting to the robustness of the finding. Two decline effects emerged: all effects were weaker than seen in the original demonstration of the effect, and an interaction appeared in one study that disappeared in the next. Surprisingly, participants who were better educated and more intelligent were more susceptible to the framing effect. This challenges speculations either that (1) the framing effect is the result of Process I thinking, or (2) higher intelligence does not change a personâ€™s execution of Process I operations.
